# 2. Cooking Recipe
## Cucumber Lemonade

### Ingredients
- 1 pound of cucumbers (peel or unpeeled are both fine)
- 1 cup of lemon juice (around 7 to 8 lemons)
- 1/3 cup of granulated sugar
- 2 cups of cold water

### Special Kitchen Tools
- Blender or food processor (for cucumber)
- Fine-mesh strainer/cheesecloth

### Steps
1. Blend cucumber in blender or food processor until pureed.
2. Strain cucumber through fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into a pitcher.
3. Stir while straining to help it move along faster.
4. Add lemon juice and sugar to pitcher and then water.
5. Mix well and let it sit in the fridge for 15 minutes.
6. Add more sugar or water if desired.
7. Serve chilled over ice. 

### Final Product

### Seasonal
- Though this drink can be made year-round, it is best enjoyed during the warmer summer months.

### Variation of Recipe
- To spice up the cucumber lemonade, a splash of seltzer can be added for an extra kick. For a bigger kick, gin can be added as well.


# 3. Euclidean Distance

## Definition
##### The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connection them ( $\overline{\textbf{pq}}$ ).
##### In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate), if **p** = ($p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_n$) and **q** = ($q_1$, $q_2$, ..., $q_n$) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem): <sup>[1]</sup>


\begin{aligned}
d(\textbf{p},\textbf{q}) = d(\textbf{q},\textbf{p}) &= \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+ \cdots + (q_n-p_n)^2}\\
&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i-p_i)^2}. \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{(1)}
\end{aligned}

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-spance is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of th space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:<sup>[1]</sup>

\begin{equation}
||\textbf{p}|| = \sqrt{p^2_1 + p^2_2 + \cdots + p^2_n} = \sqrt{\textbf{p} \cdot \textbf{p}},
\end{equation}

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
